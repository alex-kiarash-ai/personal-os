# Writing Style: Alex Research-Team Text Output

**Scope.** Every piece of running prose the research team produces: papers, research
reports, plans, scans, decision briefs, speaker scripts, the prose body of any PDF or
.docx written to `outputs/research-team/`.

**Not in scope.** Reference lists and citation strings (they follow APA/whatever
standard governs the document, not this file). Tables. Code. Quoted source titles and
direct quotations, which are reproduced exactly as published even when they break a
rule here.

**Where this sits.** `soul.md` Voice Rules and Detection-proofing govern prose written
**in Shaheen's own voice** (email, LinkedIn, cover letters). This file governs prose
written **in the analytical third person**. The anti-AI half of soul.md carries over
whole: no em-dashes, no hedges, no stock transitions, no parallel triplets, no uniform
cadence. The register half does not. Do not import ESL-direct fragments, contractions
or dropped articles into an academic paper. `vault/me/writing-style-notes.md` stays the
learned-edits log for voice work; this is the standing house style for research output.

On conflict with an external standard (APA7, MLA, Chicago, a journal template), the
external standard wins and the conflict gets flagged, never silently resolved. See
[[research/apa7-brand-conflicts]].

## 1. Banned constructions

### 1.1 Hedging that carries no information

Delete on sight. If the hedge is doing real epistemic work, replace it with the actual
uncertainty and its source.

Banned: *it is important to note, it is worth noting, it should be noted, it should be
considered, it must be noted, it is interesting to note, needless to say, it goes
without saying, arguably, it could be argued, one might argue, to some extent,
somewhat, fairly, rather, quite, relatively, generally speaking, by and large, in many
ways, may be seen as, can be seen as, tends to be, seems to suggest, appears to
indicate, that said, of course, clearly, obviously.*

Wrong: *It is important to note that effects on anxiety are arguably contested.*
Right: *Effects on anxiety are contested (Gu, 2025).*

The test: delete the hedge. If the sentence still says the same thing, the hedge was
never carrying anything.

### 1.2 Connective filler

Banned as sentence or paragraph openers: *moreover, furthermore, additionally, in
addition, besides, also, similarly, likewise, notably, indeed, overall, in conclusion,
to conclude, in summary, to summarise, first and foremost, last but not least, on the
other hand.*

These pretend to be logical connectives while carrying no logic. A real connective
names the relationship: *because*, *so*, *which means*, *against that*, *the exception
is*. If two sentences need glue, the second one is usually in the wrong place.

Wrong: *Moreover, the Iraqi AI literature is young.*
Right: *The Iraqi AI literature is young.* (The sequence already implies the addition.)

### 1.3 Three-item lists that are not three things

The tricolon is the single most common defect in current output (30 instances in one
6,000-word paper, 14.4 per 100 sentences). It is a rhythm habit, not a finding.

Before writing three coordinate items, count the real ones. Two is more honest when
the third is a synonym or a makeweight. Four is more honest when you cut one to make
the rhythm work. Keep three only when the source genuinely has three.

Wrong: *constraints on infrastructure, connectivity, and training* (connectivity is a
subset of infrastructure).
Right: *constraints on infrastructure and teacher training.*

Legitimate three: *the ideal L2 self, the ought-to L2 self, and the L2 learning
experience.* That is Dörnyei's actual tripartite model. The source has three.

### 1.4 Restatement

A sentence that repeats its predecessor in different words is a deletion, not an
emphasis. Test: cover the second sentence. If the paragraph loses no information, the
sentence was restatement.

### 1.5 Abstract nouns doing a verb's work

Nominalisation buries the action. Watch *the X of*, *provide an analysis*, *conduct an
examination*, *make a contribution*, *achieve an improvement*, *plays an important
role*, *serves as*.

Wrong: *The durability of the gains is an open question.*
Right: *Nobody has tested whether the gains last.*

Wrong: *AI tools play an important role in motivation.*
Right: *AI tools raise motivation* (with the effect size and the citation).

### 1.6 Uniform sentence length

See rule 2.

### 1.7 Conclusions that summarise

A conclusion states what is now true, what follows, and what is still unknown. It does
not recite the sections above. Banned openers: *this article reviewed*, *this paper
has examined*, *in summary*, *as discussed above*.

The current paper's conclusion is the reference standard for this rule. It runs 13, 9,
4, 3, 17, 42 words, states the finding, names the two open questions in seven words
total, then closes on what the proposed work would produce. It summarises nothing.

### 1.8 Em-dashes

See rule 5.

## 2. Sentence rhythm

**No three consecutive sentences within 5 words of each other in length.**

This is checkable and it is checked. Vary deliberately: a long sentence that carries
the evidence, then a short one that lands the point. The regularity of evenly measured
sentences is itself the strongest AI tell, more than any single word choice.

Measured baseline at the time of writing: 4.3 uniform runs per 100 sentences in the
EFL paper, 7.7 in the speaker script. Target is zero.

Worked example, from the paper's conclusion: 13, 9, 4, 3, 17, 42. No three consecutive
sentences sit within 5 words. That is the shape to aim at.

Failing example, from the same paper: three consecutive sentences of 27, 28 and 30
words. Nothing is wrong with any one of them. Together they read as machine output.

## 3. Claims

**Every assertion either carries a citation or is explicitly marked as the author's
inference. No unsourced confident statements.**

Three permitted forms:

1. **Sourced.** *Chatbot-assisted language learning produced g = 0.53 across 61 samples
   (S. Zhang et al., 2023).*
2. **Marked inference.** *The pattern suggests, though no study has tested it directly,
   that...* The marker must name what is missing, not just soften the verb.
3. **Stated scope limit.** *No Iraqi study has measured this in a federal public
   university.* An absence claim is still a claim and still needs a basis.

Banned: the confident unsourced middle. *AI tools are transforming language education*
is either sourced or deleted.

When the underlying research is thin, say so in the text. Do not reach for a vaguer
verb to cover a gap. Vagueness used as cover is the defect this rule exists to catch,
and in an editing pass it gets flagged as a CONTENT GAP and left for the author.

---

## 4. Structure

**Paragraphs argue. They do not enumerate.**

A paragraph needs a claim, its evidence, and what follows from it. A paragraph that
only lists items belongs in a table or a real list, or it should be cut.

Test: state the paragraph's argument in one sentence. If the only honest summary is
"here are some things about X", it is not a paragraph.

A real list is fine as a list. The defect is list-shaped prose wearing paragraph
clothes.

---

## 5. Punctuation

**No em-dashes.** Not one. Use a comma, a full stop, or rewrite the sentence.

Most em-dashes mark a thought the writer did not want to commit to a structure. That
is exactly why they read as machine output. The rewrite is almost always better than
the comma.

Wrong: *The design is sound — assuming the sampling holds.*
Right: *The design is sound if the sampling holds.*

**En-dashes** are permitted only in numeric ranges (417–431, 2005–2009) where the
governing standard requires them. Never as a substitute for the banned em-dash.

**Carve-out.** Dashes inside a quoted source title are reproduced exactly as published.
`Iraq – Understanding English language teaching and learning` keeps its en-dash because
that is the title. Correcting a source is a citation error, not a style fix.

Measured baseline: 70 em-dashes in one 1,850-word plan, against 0 in three other files
from the same period. The rule is old; the compliance is inconsistent. That is what
this file is for.

---

## 6. Register

**Sparse and factual. State the point, do not build up to it.**

- Put the finding in the first sentence of the paragraph. Do not walk the reader to it.
- Present tense for what is true, past tense for what a study did.
- Concrete subjects doing real verbs. Prefer *Iraqi students use ChatGPT* to *there is
  evidence of ChatGPT usage among Iraqi students*.
- No throat-clearing openers. *This section will discuss* is deletable in every case.
- No rhetorical questions.
- No hype adjectives: *transformative, revolutionary, cutting-edge, groundbreaking,
  seamless, robust, powerful.*
- Numbers beat adjectives. *g = 0.53* beats *a strong effect*.

Calm, technical, deep water, matching the brand tone line in `brand-config.md`. The
difference between this register and Shaheen's private register is formality, not
honesty. Both refuse to pad.

## 7. How this gets enforced

Rule-only, like the other gates. The editing pass runs after generation, not during:
generate the argument first, then edit against this file. Every edit logs the original
text, the replacement, and the rule number that triggered it.

Rules 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.5, 2, 5 are mechanically checkable and there is a working
detector for each (`scripts/`-side tooling built 2026-08-06, currently run on demand).
Rules 1.4, 1.6, 1.7, 3, 4, 6 need a reading pass.

A vague sentence whose vagueness comes from thin underlying research is never fixed by
editing. It is flagged CONTENT GAP and left for the author.
