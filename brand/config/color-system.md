# Brand File: Color System

**LAW — on conflict, this file wins.** (Hierarchy formalized 2026-07-08: this file is the single source of color law — palette, hexes, tokens, ratios, contrast pairings, usage rules. `brand-config.md` is application only.)

**Owner:** Shaheen Kiarash
**Version:** 1.0 (July 2026)
**Audience:** This document is written for Alex. It defines the official brand palette, what each color means, exactly where each color is allowed to be used, and where it is not. Follow it as a specification, not as inspiration.

---

## 1. Brand Personality

This palette communicates three things, in this order:

1. **Depth and trust.** The dark ink and teal family forms the foundation. It reads as calm, technical, and professional, like deep water or a night sky.
2. **Clarity and freshness.** The cyan and aqua tones bring a sense of growth, renewal, and modern tech.
3. **Energy and action.** The golden orange family is the spark. It exists only to draw the eye to the things that matter: calls to action, highlights, key numbers.

The red family (Rusty Spice, Oxidized Iron, Brown Red) carries urgency and intensity. It is a functional tool, not a decoration. It appears rarely, and only with purpose.

**One sentence summary:** a deep teal, tech-forward brand with a single warm accent, where red means "pay attention now."

## 2. The Palette

| # | Name | Hex | RGB | Role |
|---|------|-----|-----|------|
| 1 | Ink Black | `#001219` | 0, 18, 25 | Primary background (dark mode), primary text (light mode) |
| 2 | Dark Teal | `#005f73` | 0, 95, 115 | Primary brand color |
| 3 | Dark Cyan | `#0a9396` | 10, 147, 150 | Secondary brand color, links, active states |
| 4 | Pearl Aqua | `#94d2bd` | 148, 210, 189 | Highlights, secondary text on dark, soft surfaces |
| 5 | Vanilla Custard | `#e9d8a6` | 233, 216, 166 | Warm neutral, subtle backgrounds, dividers |
| 6 | Golden Orange | `#ee9b00` | 238, 155, 0 | Primary CTA, key highlights |
| 7 | Burnt Caramel | `#ca6702` | 202, 103, 2 | CTA hover / pressed state |
| 8 | Rusty Spice | `#bb3e03` | 187, 62, 3 | Strong emphasis, warnings |
| 9 | Oxidized Iron | `#ae2012` | 174, 32, 18 | Errors, urgency, critical alerts |
| 10 | Brown Red | `#9b2226` | 155, 34, 38 | Deep error surfaces, destructive-action hover |

---

## 3. Color Hierarchy and Ratios

Never use all ten colors at once. A screen or asset should feel like it uses 3 to 4 colors, not 10. Apply the 60-30-10 rule:

- **60% Foundation:** Ink Black `#001219` (dark mode) or white `#ffffff` (light mode).
- **30% Brand:** Dark Teal `#005f73` and Dark Cyan `#0a9396` for structure: headers, cards, nav, illustrations, section blocks. Pearl Aqua `#94d2bd` supports them for lighter touches.
- **10% Accent:** Golden Orange `#ee9b00` only. One clear accent per view. If everything is orange, nothing is.

The red family sits outside this ratio entirely. It is reserved for system states (errors, alerts, destructive actions) and should be absent from a healthy, neutral screen.

---

## 4. Exact Usage Rules

### 4.1 Backgrounds

- **Primary dark surface:** `#001219`. This is the default canvas for the brand in dark mode: website hero, slides, social posts.
- **Elevated dark surface (cards, panels):** `#005f73` at low opacity over `#001219`, or a solid step between them (e.g. `#00232e`).
- **Light surface:** `#ffffff` or an off-white. Use `#e9d8a6` only as a soft tint for callout boxes or section breaks, never as the main page background.
- **Never** use the red family or `#ee9b00` as a large background area.

### 4.2 Text

Accessibility is not optional. Use these pairings only:

**On dark backgrounds (`#001219`, `#005f73`):**
- Primary text: white `#ffffff`
- Secondary text: Pearl Aqua `#94d2bd`
- Tertiary / captions: Vanilla Custard `#e9d8a6`

**On light backgrounds (white, `#e9d8a6`):**
- Primary text: Ink Black `#001219`
- Secondary text / headings: Dark Teal `#005f73`
- Links and interactive text: Dark Cyan `#0a9396`

**Do not** set body text in Golden Orange, Burnt Caramel, or any red. These colors fail contrast at small sizes and read as alerts. They may appear in large display headlines or big stat numbers, but never in paragraphs.

### 4.3 Buttons and Calls to Action

- **Primary CTA:** background `#ee9b00`, text `#001219` (dark text on orange, never white).
- **Hover / pressed:** background shifts to `#ca6702`, text stays `#001219`.
- **Secondary button:** transparent or dark background, 1px border and text in `#0a9396`.
- **Destructive action:** background `#ae2012`, text `#ffffff`, hover `#9b2226`.
- One primary CTA per screen or asset. Everything else is secondary.

### 4.4 States and Feedback

- **Success / positive:** Dark Cyan `#0a9396` or Pearl Aqua `#94d2bd`.
- **Warning:** Rusty Spice `#bb3e03`.
- **Error / critical:** Oxidized Iron `#ae2012`, with `#9b2226` for pressed or deep variants.
- **Error / recording text on DARK surfaces (small text):** Signal Coral `#ff8a75` (semantic token `--error-text-dark`). Adopted 2026-07-12 (D5 of the upgrade): the palette red `#ae2012` reads muddy at small sizes on `#001219`/`#00232e` (~4:1), while Signal Coral clears it at ~8.4:1. Use ONLY for small error/recording state text on dark cards (e.g. the HQ "note not saved" line, the mic recording countdown), never as a fill, border, or on light surfaces.

### 4.5 Charts and Data Visualization

Order of series colors: `#0a9396`, `#ee9b00`, `#005f73`, `#94d2bd`, `#ca6702`. Reserve the reds for negative values, thresholds, or alerts in the data itself. Gridlines and axes: `#94d2bd` at 20 to 30% opacity on dark, `#001219` at 15% on light.

**Approved data-viz exception (2026-07-12, D10):** a network/force graph's own self/"me" node may render pure white `#ffffff` for maximum contrast against the teal node field (the Alex HQ Brain graph does this). This is a single-node legibility choice, not a series color; it does not count against the one-accent rule.

### 4.6 Gradients

Allowed gradients, use sparingly (hero sections, social covers):

- `#001219` to `#005f73` (depth)
- `#005f73` to `#0a9396` (brand)
- `#ee9b00` to `#ca6702` (accent, small elements only)

Never blend the teal family directly into the red family in a single gradient.

## 5. Do and Don't Summary

**Do**
- Keep large areas calm: Ink Black, white, and the teal family carry the brand.
- Use Golden Orange as the single point of energy per view.
- Keep the reds for warnings, errors, and genuinely urgent messages.
- Check contrast before shipping anything with text.

**Don't**
- Don't use more than one accent color in the same component.
- Don't put orange or red text on teal backgrounds.
- Don't use the red family decoratively (icons, borders, backgrounds "for variety").
- Don't introduce outside colors without checking Section 6 first.

## 6. Extended Palette (Optional, Use With Restraint)

These companions may be used when the core palette needs support, for example in illustrations, moodboards, or marketing one-offs. They are never primary brand colors.

| Companion | Hex | Pairs with | Purpose |
|-----------|-----|-----------|---------|
| Soft Coral | `#ff6f61` | `#005f73` | Lively contrast in illustration |
| Pastel Peach | `#ffccbc` | `#0a9396` | Warm soft fill |
| Muted Lavender | `#e3e4f8` | `#94d2bd` | Calm light surface |
| Pale Gray | `#e9e9e9` | `#e9d8a6` | Neutral light surface |
| Burnt Umber | `#7b3e3f` | `#ee9b00` | Depth and anchoring |
| Slate Blue | `#2b3a67` | `#ca6702` | Grounding contrast |
| Teal | `#008080` | `#bb3e03` | Cool balance |
| Warm Cream | `#fff5e1` | `#ae2012` | Softening error surfaces |

Rule of thumb: maximum one companion color per asset, and never in the core UI.
