# Item 3 (2026-07-20): numbers-drift check for the identity-carrying master reference.
# Zero-token. Called from check.mjs as C19. Detect, never repair.
#
# REPOINTED + EXPANDED 2026-07-25 (stress-test fix F2). The master reference MOVED out of the repo
# on 2026-07-21, but this check still hardcoded the old in-repo path - now a 481-byte retirement
# stub - so it read the stub, found no claims, and returned 0 (falsely clean). The living doc was
# guarded by nothing while its claims drifted (standing sections said "V1-V11" while the code ran
# V1-V12, the escrow date was stale, etc). The fixes:
#   (1) the master path is read from system/manifest.json meta.paths.master_reference_md (single
#       source of truth, %USERPROFILE%-anchored) so a future move updates ONE place and cannot
#       silently rot a hardcoded literal again;
#   (2) an ABSENT master returns 2 (amber), never 0 - so a move not reflected in the manifest, or a
#       fresh clone without the out-of-repo doc, is SURFACED, never hidden behind a green;
#   (3) the claim-set is DERIVED from ground-truth sources (not frozen numbers): the recovery
#       C-count from check.mjs, the validator V-count from validate-alex.js, the non-retired project
#       count from the manifest, and the escrow attestation date from state/passphrase-attested.txt.
#
# Claims are checked ONLY in the STANDING part of the doc (everything before the "## 11. Running
# changes" section). The dated running-changes entries legitimately carry the count/version AT THAT
# DATE ("added C18, now V1-V12"); flagging those would false-positive on every historical line and
# break the living-doc-with-running-changes model this check protects. Each new claim needs its own
# (doc-regex + derived-truth) pair; pure prose drift stays the monthly /lint's job.
#
# Exit 0 = consistent - 2 = drift found (one line per finding) - 1 = checker could not compute truth.

    """The identity docs must be ONE file object each, reached through a junction - not two synced copies.

    REWRITTEN 2026-07-25 (Shaheen: "APPLY"), replacing a byte-equality compare that was only ever a
    monitor. History worth keeping, because it is the whole argument: the two folder copies of each doc
    were unified BY HAND on 07-24, drifted within a day, were unified again on 07-25, and drifted AGAIN
    85 minutes later while the permanent fix was being designed - a parallel session correctly appended a
    running-changes entry to the canonical and the duplicate silently fell behind. A weekly report that
    ends in a human re-copy cannot clear the permanence bar.

    So the invariant changed from "the two copies have equal bytes" to "there is only one file". The real
    files live in meta.paths.identity_doc_real_dir; every other location is a DIRECTORY JUNCTION into it,
    so each legacy path still resolves and divergence is not detected, it is impossible.

    WHY A JUNCTION AND NOT A HARDLINK - measured on this machine, not assumed: a replace-style save
    (write temp, rename over target; what Word, python-docx and most editors do) SILENTLY breaks a
    hardlink, leaving two files that look correct to anything not comparing file ids. The same write
    through a junction keeps one file, because the junction is on the DIRECTORY and NTFS resolves it
    before the file is ever created or renamed.

    MANDATORY IMPLEMENTATION NOTE: pin the test to st_reparse_tag. os.path.islink() returns FALSE for a
    junction (verified on this box, Python 3.12), so an islink-based check would green-light a fork.
