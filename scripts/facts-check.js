/*
 * scripts/facts-check.js - recovery check C21: standing DOCS tested against the bi-temporal fact
 * ledger (system/recall/facts.db). The Recall Spine's rent-payer (upgrade plan Phase 1.3).
 *
 * DIRECTION (this is the whole point): the DOC is the test SUBJECT; facts.db is the EXPECTATION. A
 * doc that claims a value the ledger disproves is flagged. This does NOT reintroduce the V6
 * anti-pattern (deriving an expectation FROM prose): facts.db is derived from STRUCTURED sources
 * (manifest, validate-alex.js registry, check.mjs headers, schtasks, skills-lock, the attestation
 * file), and the prose is checked against THAT. The ST-20 / FR-04 "a doc lying about the system"
 * class becomes one deterministic diff.
 *
 * NON-DUPLICATION NOTE: the plan (2026-07-24) had C20 re-enter the out-of-repo ALEX-OS-master.md +
 * plain-English guide into enforcement. The 2026-07-25 stress-test fix F2 ALREADY did that: C19
 * (narrative-drift-check.py) was repointed to the manifest's master path and now derives its claim
 * set from ground truth (check count, V count, project count, escrow date). So C21 does NOT duplicate
 * the master-doc numeric claims (that would create two checks fighting over one doc). C21 owns the
 * COMPLEMENTARY, IN-REPO prose-vs-structured-truth surface C19 never touches. The map grows the same
 * way C19's does: each new claim is one {doc-regex + fact} row.
 *
 * Renumbered C21 (not the plan's C20): C20 was taken by the 07-25 F1 backup-destinations check.
 *
 * Exit 0 = consistent - 2 = drift found (one line per finding) - 1 = could not compute.
 *   node scripts/facts-check.js               harvest fresh, then check
 *   node scripts/facts-check.js --no-harvest  check against facts.db as-is (nightly chain already ran harvest)

// =================================================================================================
// THE PROJECT-SPEC SWEEP (added 2026-07-29, architecture review, the CLASS fix)
// =================================================================================================
// WHY: that review found ELEVEN spec-vs-registry disagreements across work/NN/CLAUDE.md, and the
// reason they had all accumulated silently was simple - the project specs were the one surface with
// no checker at all. C1 asserts a spec FILE exists, C10 notices it changed, V7 reads schedule prose,
// but nothing had ever read what a spec CLAIMS about itself. Fixing eleven sentences by hand without
// this would just reset the clock.
//
// A generic sweep, deliberately NOT 32 hand-written assertion rows: a per-project row set would drift
// exactly like the prose it polices, and a new project would silently arrive uncovered.
//
// DIRECTION LAW HOLDS: the expectation comes from system/manifest.json (structured), the spec prose is
// the test subject. Never the reverse.
//
// SCOPE IS DELIBERATELY NARROW. Only two claims are asserted, because both are decidable from
// structured data with no judgement. Lifecycle-state prose was evaluated and REJECTED for v1: specs
// name states in history lines, in comparisons to other projects, and in superseded notes, so any
// regex broad enough to catch a real drift also fires on correct prose, and a checker with false
// positives gets ignored, which is worse than no checker.
