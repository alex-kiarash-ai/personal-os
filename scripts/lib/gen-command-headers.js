// gen-command-headers.js - emits a GENERATED state/trigger header into each LIVE/EVENT command file
// (command-layer review F-3/F-4/F-6/F-11, 2026-07-28).
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS. The 2026-07-28 read-pass found six command files contradicting system/manifest.json
// on trigger, schedule, method or source of truth. That was not six unrelated typos, it was the
// predicted outcome of the system's own principle applied unevenly: every surface with a checker agreed
// with reality, and the one large prose surface with nothing asserting it drifted six times. check.mjs
// C1 asserts a declared command FILE EXISTS and C2 catches orphan command files; validator V7 uses
// command NAMES to bind schedule.md sections to projects. All three are filename-level. NOTHING read
// command file CONTENT.
//
// THE SHAPE OF THE FIX. Not "parse the prose and compare it to the manifest" - that is the V6
// anti-pattern (a validator deriving its expectation FROM prose), which is exactly what blocked the
// generator on 2026-07-24. Instead: REPLACE the prose claim with generated truth between markers, the
// same mechanism already trusted for the CLAUDE.md routing table. State and trigger then cannot drift,
// because they are no longer written by hand. V15 asserts the block still matches the registry, which
// catches a hand-edit or a stale file at commit time.
//
// SCOPE: LIVE + EVENT projects only (Shaheen's call 2026-07-28). ON-DEMAND, DORMANT, PARKED and RETIRED
// commands have no schedule worth asserting, and a smaller diff is a reviewable diff.
