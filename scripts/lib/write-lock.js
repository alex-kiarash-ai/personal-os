/*
 * scripts/lib/write-lock.js - the ONE cross-process mutex for repo-surface mutation.
 *
 * WHY (stress-test finding F-08, 2026-07-25): Alex is driven by whatever sessions Shaheen happens to
 * have open, and two of them can mutate the same generated surface at the same time. This is not
 * theoretical - it has happened twice:
 *   - 2026-07-20: three `download this skill` requests fired back-to-back, parallel sessions raced
 *     `skills-lock.json`, and one session's rewrite transiently mis-attributed one skill and DELETED
 *     another. The fix at the time was a mutex INSIDE skills-installer.js, which manual sessions never
 *     call - so the actual incident shape stayed unguarded.
 *   - 2026-07-24: a generator run and a soul.md voice re-sync collided (error-log); it was benign only
 *     because validation happened to fail first.
 * The generator (CLAUDE.md routing region + docs + tokens) and the skills installer (CLAUDE.md
 * ALEX-AUTO-SKILLS region + skills-lock.json) write the SAME files, so they share ONE lock name by
 * design: an interleave between them is exactly what must be impossible.
 *
 * Mechanism: `fs.mkdirSync` is atomic on Windows and POSIX - it either creates the directory or throws
 * EEXIST, with no read-then-write window. A holder file inside carries pid + start time + label so a
 * stuck lock is diagnosable, and a lock older than staleMs (a crashed run) is STOLEN rather than left
 * to wedge the system forever.
 *
 * Semantics are the CALLER's choice, deliberately:
 *   - generate-alex.js FAILS LOUD when it cannot acquire (the caller asked for surfaces to be
 *     regenerated; silently doing nothing would be a lie).
 *   - skills-installer.js DEFERS (its weekly run is opportunistic; the next run picks it up).
 *
 * Usage:
 *   const lock = require('./lib/write-lock');
 *   const held = lock.acquire({ label: 'generate-alex' });
 *   if (!held.ok) { ...caller decides: fail loud or defer... }
 *   try { ...mutate... } finally { held.release(); }
